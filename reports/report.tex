\section{Definition}

\subsection{Project Overview}

Advances in agricultural technology over the past 30 years have made
it easier for farmers to manage their farms, particularly when the
farms are comprised of multiple fields greater than 1000 acres in
size. The use of GPS on aerial imagery, drones, etc. have been instrumental
in precision agriculture \cite{liakos_machine_2018}.

But one of the challenges of modern farming is the detection of plant
diseases. For large farms in particular, it is time-consuming for
a farmer to manually check each growing plant for disease. It can
potentially be more cost-effective to diagnose plant diseases with
automated tools \cite{fujita_basic_2016}.

For this project, I built a Python library that implements a multi-class classifier that functions as a plant disease detector.

The library includes functionality to do many of the tasks required in machine learning research, among them image preprocessing necessary to prepare the data for classification, scripts to train classifier itself, and utility functions to help evaluate performance.

\subsection{Problem Statement}

My main objectives for this project were to build a library that implements plant disease classification and can act as a framework with which to do further research in this subject area. It can be used to complete an entire machine learning pipeline from training to deployment.

To build this library, I needed to:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Retrieve the PlantVillage Dataset (\url{https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset}).
	\item Prepare the raw color images from the PlantVillage Dataset for consumption by the model.
	\item Train the model to classify the different diseases for a given species of plant.
	\item Save the model as a TensorFlow Lite object for use in an embedded system.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Metrics}

Accuracy and loss were the main metrics used in this project.

\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Data Exploration}

The main datasets used were obtained from the PlantVillage Dataset: \url{https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset}

The dataset consists of 20,638 images each of which have the dimensions
256 by 256 pixels and are all colored, non-greyscale JPEGs. The images
are split up into several folders, labelled according to the plant
species (e.g. Pepper Bell) and whether they are healthy or not (e.g.
Pepper bell healthy, Pepper bell Bacterial spot).

For this project, the colored photos were used for analysis and training. Due to time constraints, the scope of the project was narrowed down to one species - Tomato.

\subsection{Algorithms and Techniques}

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was selected as the classification algorithm due to its demonstrated efficacy in plant disease detection in previous studies \cite{toda_how_2019}\cite{fujita_basic_2016}.

The CNN architecture is based on AlexNet\cite{krizhevsky_imagenet_2017} and is comprised of Conv2D (which does 2D convolution), MaxPooling2D (max pooling), and Fully Connected Layers (which are a combination of Dense and Dropout layers).

This describes the layer sequence (the number indicates how many of that same layer repeats until the next one):

\begin{itemize}
	\item Conv2D (3)
	\item MaxPooling2D (1)
	\item Conv2D (2)
	\item MaxPooling2D (1)
	\item Fully-Connected with Dropout (3)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Benchmark}

The benchmark for the classifier will be the results obtained by previous studies by
Toda et al, Fuentes et al, on plant detection which all utilize a CNN as a classifier\cite{toda_how_2019} \cite{fuentes_robust_2017}.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}

Preprocessing the data was completed using these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Shuffle list of image filenames.
	\item Get labels from filenames.
	\item Split list of image filenames into training files (80\%), validation (10\%), and testing files (10\%).
	\item Create a training example for each image file so it can be added to a TFRecord (TensorFlow dataset).
	\item Create parser function to read each TFRecord batch by batch during training due to hardware limitations (limited RAM, in this case).
	\item Normalize image pixel values by dividing by 255 (representing the range of values for an RGB image).
\end{enumerate}
