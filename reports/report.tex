\section{Definition}

\subsection{Project Overview}

Farmers need a way to detect plant disease early on in the planting season without investing too much time manually checking everything themselves.

For this project, I built a Python library that implements a multi-class classifier that functions as a plant disease detector.

The library includes functionality to do many of the tasks required in machine learning research, among them image preprocessing necessary to prepare the data for classification, scripts to train classifier itself, and utility functions to help evaluate performance.
